Mandarin Chinese 101 is an online course for, as the name suggests, learning Mandarin Chinese. 

It is still under construction, and has been a tool for me to learn web development as well as product development.

The core of the product is a set of lessons which teach sequentially more difficult concepts by making use of real life vocabulary and sentence structures. This attempts to counter one of the greatest difficulties of learning Chinese, which is that the sentence structure and syntax are markedly different from those of nearly all other languages. 

The goal is that by teaching the student a sequence of roughly 2000 real-life, useful, sentences, the course will also teach sentence structure, grammar, and vocabulary. 

This project has allowed me to combine two of my greatest passions, education and technology, while learning how to iterate and built useful products. 

Take a look at the site for more information.
